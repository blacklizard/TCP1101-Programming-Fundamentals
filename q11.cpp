-----------------------------------------------------------
Question No   : 11 (BONUS !!)
Question Type : Write a program
-----------------------------------------------------------

Write a program to prompt a user to enter two non-zero integers (say n and k).
The value n is always larger than or equal to value k.
Then, output the number of permutations of k from n using the following formula:

                           n!
              result =  --------
                         (n-k)!

where the symbol "!" is the factorial.

Note: Permutation is an "arrangement" of a set of objects.
Example:
a.) Consider 3 letters of a, b and c. How many possible ways that it can be arranged
if 3 letters are to be arranged?
The result is 6. See the arrangement: abc, acb, bac, cab, bca, cba.
And the calculation is:                3!
                           Result = ------- = 6
                                     (3-3)!

b.) Consider the 3 letters a, b and c again. How many possible ways that it can be arranged
if 2 letters are to be arranged?
The result is 6. See the arrangement: ab, ac, ba, bc, ca, cb.
And the calculation is:                3!
                           Result = ------- = 6
                                     (3-2)!

Sample Run 1 (from the second example above):

   Input -> 3  2
   6

Sample Run 2:

   Input -> 4  2
   12
